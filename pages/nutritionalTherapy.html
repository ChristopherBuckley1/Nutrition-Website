                <h2> Nutritional Therapy
                </h2>
                
            <p>   Nutritional Therapy is suitable for everyone, adults and children. It is suitable  for those who would like to improve their diet, overall health,                                and well being.</p>
            
            <br>
            <p> Nutritional Therapy helps you to identify the foods that make you look and feel your best, and those that may be compromising your health. 
Nutritional Therapy can also support nutritional status, which can benefit someone going through traditional cancer therapies like chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

<br>
<br>
I will work with you to devise a meal plan that is nutritionally balanced, practical, enjoyable and sustainable. 
If any foods need to be reduced or eliminated for a period of time, I will suggest viable alternatives that will maintain nutritional needs.

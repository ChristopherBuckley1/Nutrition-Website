                        We must take responsibility  for the fuel we provide our bodies each day. By
                        taking steps to eat whole, unprocessed food from the Earth, we are taking steps 
                        to become the healthiest version of ourselves.

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Courtney.
                I am a qualified Nutritional Therapist with a 3-year diploma in Nutritional Therapy from CNM in
                Cork. A qualified Nutritional Therapist is trained in basic biochemistry, anatomy and physiology
                and pathology, and has undertaken 200 hours of supervised clinical practice. As such, a
                Nutritional Therapist is qualified to work in private practice and see clients on a one to one or
                group basis.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>

            
                I am also a ten year survivor of stage 3 breast cancer. I was diagnosed in March of 2011 with
                invasive ductal carcinoma, and began researching the root causes of cancer to increase my
                chances of survival. What I found out was that cancer was not that mysterious at all. In fact,
                many common cancers are created in the body because of nutritional deficiencies, and cellular
                toxicity brought on by bad food and lifestyle choices and stress. We are not helpless victims of a
                mysterious disease , we can significantly increase our chances of survival by adjusting our diet.
                We can encourage our body&#39;s own innate immune system and detoxification abilities by
                learning to eliminate much of our needless stress, and by choosing to eat an
                organically-grown whole food plant based diet. To quote one of the greatest physicians of
                history , Hippocrates, &quot;Let Food Be Thy Medicine, and Let Medicine Be Thy Food.&quot;
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It was a difficult road I will admit, being the most difficult thing I've ever done. I spent two years
                rebuilding my immune system with fresh organic food and juices, and I watched in awe of my
                body as it slowly healed itself. It was absolutely worth the two years of hard work.
                I have created this website with you in mind. It can be used as a guidepost for your health
                journey, a place for you to explore information on the subject of using food as medicine, and as
                a catalyst to inspire and help you find answers. I look forward to sharing my knowledge with
                you,
                To your health!
